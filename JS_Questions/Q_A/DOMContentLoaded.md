# Difference between `document.load` and `DOMContentLoaded` Events

## `DOMContentLoaded` Event

- Fired when the initial HTML document is completely loaded and parsed.
- Does not wait for assets to finish loading, such as:
  - Stylesheets
  - Images
  - Subframes
- Indicates the DOM is ready for manipulation.

## `load` Event

- Fired when the entire page has finished loading, including:
  - All dependent resources (stylesheets, images, etc.)
  - The whole page is fully rendered.
- Waits for all assets to finish loading before firing.

## Key Differences:

- **Timing**: `DOMContentLoaded` fires sooner, while `load` fires later, after all resources are loaded.
- **Scope**: `DOMContentLoaded` focuses on the HTML document, while `load` considers the entire page, including external resources.

## When to Use Each:

- **DOMContentLoaded**: Ideal for manipulating the DOM, executing JavaScript, or initializing libraries.
- **load**: Suitable for scenarios requiring all resources to be fully loaded, such as image processing or page analysis.

By understanding the distinction between these events, you can optimize your code's execution and improve user experience.
